  <p>We have made a website that converts [insert database used] into a graph! This website also has all the information about us, it took a long time and a lot of hard work to get this website to the stage that it is. On this part of our website, you can find how we worked together on this project, who did what and how it all went. Clicking on this you can go to our <a href="About.html">About page</a> this shows our contact information in case you would like to know more about us and the website. On the <a href="Contacts.html">Live Data</a> side, you can find a graph representing our way of turning the data into a graph. And finally, there is the <a href="index.html">Home page</a> in case you just wanted to admire our lord and savior!</p>

    <h1>Chapter 2: How did the teamwork go and how did it go?</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Our teamwork was pretty good; each one of us was given a part of the point document to work on. It was shared as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I (Samy) helped Kobe with the frontend after seeing that we kind of left it after we were done with the CSS. And thus also created the PowerPoint in a way and kept up with the teamwork outside of GitHub.</li>
    <li>Thomas followed the PYNQ tutorial and followed the setup video and worked with POSTSQL.</li>
    <li>Ceyhan did the translation from the database to the JSON file.</li>
    <li>And finally, Kobe helped Samy with the creation of the CSS and the PHP!</li>
