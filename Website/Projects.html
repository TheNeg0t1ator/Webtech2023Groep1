        <p>We have made a website that converts [insert database used] into a graph! This website also has all the information about us,
        it took a long time and a lot of hard work to get this website to the stage that it is. On this part of our website you can find how we worked together on this project
        who did what and how it all went. Clicking on this you can go to our  <a href="About.html">About page</a> this shows our contact information
        in case you would like to know more about us and the website, on the <a href="Contacts.html">Live Data</a> side you can find a graph representing the
        our way of turning the data into a graph. And finally there is the home page in case you just wanted to admire our lord and savior!</p>

        <p>Our teamwork was pretty good each one of us was given a part of the point document to work on it was shared as the following</p>
        <li>I (Samy) helped Kobe with the frontend after seeing that we kind of left it after we were done with the css. And thus also created
            the powerpoint in a way and kept up with the teamwork outside of the github.</p>
        <li>Thomas followed the pynq tutorial and followed the setup video and worked with POSTSQL</p>
        <li>Ceyhan did the translation from the database to the Json file</p>
        <li>And finally Kobe helped Samy with the creation of the CSS and the PHP!</p>
